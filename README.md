# Budget Manager

This application allows you to control your expenses on a monthly basis, adding a maximum limit to your budget and then recording what you spend your money on.

It was created with ReactJs and Vite as part of one of the projects of the course "React - The Complete Guide: Hooks Context Redux MERN +15 Apps" taught by Juan Pablo de la Torre Valdez on Udemy.

Although the interface is similar to the one done by the teacher in the course, I implemented some refactorings as I went along.
